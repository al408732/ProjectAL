				<h1>Welcome to Back to Basics!</h1>
				<p>From Street Fighter to Guilty Gear, fighting games and it's community use universal terms to describe many differnt manuvers or properties. This can be
				pretty daunting if you're a new player. Character tutorials and guides can be pretty confusing if you don't know what "Oki" and "Wake up" means.<p>
				<p class="warning"><b>This website aims to teach you the basic terms used in fighting games. Many fighting games use more terms only used by them. If you are 
				if you are searching for a specific fighting game it may not be here.</b></p>

				<p>Learning fighting games, like Street Fighter&trade; can be daunting. Not only do you have to worry about picking your favorite character and practicing, 
				but once you research about the fighting game you will see a lot of terminiology that seems to be all made up! I know how confusing it can be 
				when someone says "oki" or "plus on block" and thats why I wanted to create a glossary of the many terms that are thrown around by the fighting 
				game community so many beginners can learn what many of the veterans are saying which can help to improve all your future matches!</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>I do want to perface this with that there are so many different terms, some of which are only used in specific genres or fighting game titles, 
				listing every single one of these terms would overwhelm many. I will only be listing and explaining the terms I believe are the ones you would hear
				by veterans, tutorial videos, and tournaments commentators.</p>
