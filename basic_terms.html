				<h1>Numpad Notation</h1>
				<img src="images/numpad-notation.jpg" alt="The numpad notation which displays a numpad and accoicates the numbers with directions.">
				<div class="mobile">
					<p>The numpad notation is a universal notation that assigns a direction with a number on the numpad of a keyboard For example,
					4 means left, 6 means right, 2 means down, 8 means up, and 5 is a neutral postion where you are not pushing any buttons.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="tablet-desktop">
					<p>The numpad notation is one of the universal notations given to buttons and directions. This notation is maily based on the arrangement of the number pad on a keyboard. For example,
					4 means left, 6 means right, 2 means down, 8 means up, and 5 is a neutral postion where you are not pushing any buttons. Using the numpad notation makes it simple and easy for any player
					to understand which direction and motions to perform when inputing a move. For example, Street Fighter's Ryu has a special move called "hadouken", which requires you to input down
					diagonally down right, right, and finally punch, can be easily as translated as 236 punch.</p>
